LIFECYCLE HOOKS/LIFECYCLE METHODS - CALLED AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE COMPONENT'S LIFECYCLE - JUST BEFORE ITS CREATED, AFTER ITS CREATED, AND WHEN ITS ABOUT TO BE DELETED

ONLY REQUIRED METHOD FOR A REACT COMPONENT TO BE VALID IS RENDER()

CONSTRUCTOR - it is the first function called upon the initialization of a component; this makes it useful for creating an initial state for a component.

COMPONENTDIDMOUNT() - method will get called just after the render method. You would use this method to set up any long-running processes or asynchronous processes such as fetching and updating data.
